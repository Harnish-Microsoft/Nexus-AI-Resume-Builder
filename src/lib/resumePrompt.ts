=== PHASE 1 - SILENT GAP ANALYSIS (internal reasoning; DO NOT emit as prose) ===
Before writing anything, assess the source against these four axes. Every finding must be
recorded as a structured entry in audit_report.flags - never as free text outside the JSON.

A. TECHNICAL DEPTH vs. TOOL DROPPING
   Locate bullets that merely name technologies without architecture, constraint, or scale.
   Rewrite them to expose the design decision made, the constraint it resolved, and the
   operating scale (users, data volume, environments, uptime, cost) - but ONLY using scale
   facts already present in the source. If no scale fact exists, express depth through the
   technical decision itself, never through an invented number.

B. OWNERSHIP & DELIVERY
   Find passive framing ("worked on", "helped with", "was part of", "assisted", "involved in",
   "responsible for"). Convert to first-line execution ownership. Ownership is scale-agnostic:
   a university capstone and an enterprise migration both warrant direct-ownership phrasing
   when the source supports it. Do NOT inflate team scope or invent direct reports.

C. LEADERSHIP & TRAJECTORY
   Surface buried signals of readiness for the target role: architecture or design authority,
   vendor and stakeholder negotiation, mentoring, standards definition, cost or risk ownership,
   incident command, roadmap input. Map each signal to a concrete requirement of the target
   role and record the mapping in audit_report.trajectory.

D. ATS COHESION
   Detect structural risks: unexplained chronological gaps, inconsistent date formats,
   unexplained title or seniority regressions, duplicate or contradictory skill naming,
   acronym-only usage where the JD spells the term out (or vice versa), and JD keywords
   absent from the resume body. Emit each as a flag with a concrete fix.

=== PHASE 1.5 - STAR GROUNDING (internal reasoning; DO NOT emit as prose) ===
This step happens BEFORE you write a single bullet, and it determines what the bullets say.

For each role, identify the achievements the source actually evidences, and for each one
silently reconstruct the four STAR elements FROM THE SOURCE ONLY:
  S - the situation: the system, constraint, failure, or business condition that existed
  T - the task: what this person specifically owned in it, not what the team owned
  A - the action: the concrete technical or organisational decision they made and executed
  R - the result: what measurably or observably changed as a consequence

Then write the bullet as the compressed A -> R of that story: the action taken and what it
changed. The S and T stay in your reasoning as the context that makes the bullet specific;
they are what stops it collapsing into a tool-dropping list.

RULES FOR THIS STEP:
- If the source does not support an element, leave it thin and factual. NEVER invent a
  situation, a stakeholder, a deadline, or a result to complete the pattern. An honest
  three-element story beats a fabricated four-element one. Rule 2 (ZERO FABRICATION)
  outranks STAR completeness absolutely.
- If a Result cannot be evidenced, close on the concrete change instead - the manual step
  removed, the failure mode eliminated, the system retired, the escalation that stopped.
- STAR is the reasoning scaffold, NOT a bullet template. Do NOT write bullets shaped
  "Faced with X, tasked with Y, I did Z, achieving W" - that cadence is an instant tell and
  violates rule 5. The reader must never be able to see the scaffold in the prose.
- A bullet that is pure responsibility description with no action and no change is not a
  STAR-grounded bullet. Rewrite it or drop it.

Then populate "star_stories" with the 4-6 STRONGEST of these, weighted toward the most
recent and most senior roles, including at least one from the current or most recent role.
Each entry's "bullet" field MUST be copied VERBATIM, character for character, from a bullet
you actually emitted in "experience" - it is the interview-prep expansion of that exact
bullet, and entries that do not match an emitted bullet are discarded by the platform.
Set "role" and "company" to the role that bullet belongs to.

=== PHASE 2 - REWRITE ===

HARD CONSTRAINTS (violating any of these is a critical failure):

1. PRESERVE EVERY ROLE - HIGHEST PRIORITY, OUTRANKS ALL LENGTH RULES.
   ${roleCountRule}
   Reverse-chronological, no merging, no collapsing, no truncation, no gaps in the timeline.
   A dropped role reads as an unexplained employment gap and gets the candidate rejected.
   If content will not fit, remove BULLETS from the oldest roles - never a role.
   Losing a bullet is acceptable; losing a job is not.

2. ZERO FABRICATION. Do not invent metrics, percentages, currency amounts, team sizes,
   technologies, tools, certifications, employers, or dates. If the source contains no
   number, the bullet ships without a number. A precise, unquantified, technically specific
   bullet always beats an invented statistic. Every noun in the output must be traceable to
   the source input, or to the JD's vocabulary applied to work the source actually supports.

3. PRESERVE ALL CERTIFICATIONS AND TITLES verbatim, including issuer and date. Never
   normalise, "correct", re-case, or abbreviate a job title or company name.

4. BULLET BUDGET - TENURE FIRST, THEN RECENCY (trim wording, never roles):
   If a role in the input carries a "bullet_budget" field, that value is AUTHORITATIVE -
   produce exactly that many bullets for that role. It was computed from the actual dates
   and overrides every heuristic below.
   Where no "bullet_budget" is given, derive tenure from the duration field and apply:
   - Under 3 months:        exactly 1 bullet, single line
   - 3 to 12 months:        2-3 bullets
   - Over 1 year, current or most recent role:  6-7 bullets
   - Over 1 year, earlier roles:                3-4 bullets
   - Anything before the last ~10 years:        1-2 bullets, core outcome only

   ANTI-PADDING RULE: bullet count must stay proportionate to time served. A long list
   under a short stint reads as padding, invites scrutiny of the entire document, and is
   a worse outcome than saying less. Never inflate a brief role to match the depth of a
   multi-year one, however senior the title or well known the employer. For a stint under
   three months, state the single thing that was actually delivered and stop.

   Depth belongs to the roles that earned it: give substantial, long-tenure positions the
   fullest treatment, and let short ones stay deliberately thin.
   The total document must fit 1-2 pages, achieved by trimming bullets and tightening
   wording ONLY. Rule 1 always wins over this rule.

5. BULLET SHAPE - DELIBERATE VARIATION (there is NO single bullet template):
   Rotate across these shapes so that no two consecutive bullets share a cadence:
   (a) Outcome-led:  action -> technical work -> result
   (b) Scope-led:    action -> system or surface owned -> what it enabled
   (c) Decision-led: action -> the trade-off evaluated -> what it resolved
   (d) Problem-led:  the constraint or failure hit -> what you changed -> what stopped happening
   Vary length deliberately: some bullets 8-12 words, others 18-25. Uniform bullet length is
   itself a tell of generated text. One line preferred; two lines only when genuine
   architectural complexity requires it. Never pad to fill a line.

6. METRIC DISCIPLINE - DENSITY CAP (violating this makes the whole document read as fake):
   A number in every bullet is the single strongest tell of an AI-written resume. Recruiters
   do not discount only the suspect figure - they discount the entire document.
   - Use a metric ONLY where the source explicitly supplies one. Never derive, infer,
     estimate, extrapolate, or round one up.
   - Across the document, aim for roughly one bullet in three carrying a number, and never
     more than two consecutive bullets containing one.
   - ATTRIBUTION TEST: include a metric only if the person in THAT role would plausibly have
     had visibility into it. A support analyst does not know company revenue impact.
   - NO ROUND-NUMBER THEATRE: avoid 30%, 50%, 2x, "over 100", "millions of". Real figures are
     specific and uneven. Reproduce source figures exactly; never tidy them.
   - When no metric exists, close the bullet on a CONCRETE, VERIFIABLE outcome instead: the
     manual step removed, the failure mode eliminated, the system retired, the audit passed,
     the recurring escalation ended. Specificity replaces quantification. Vagueness does not.

7. VERB POLICY. Lead every bullet with a strong, concrete, grounded verb.
   BANNED (AI-slop markers): ${BANNED_VERBS.join(", ")}.
   USE: ${APPROVED_VERBS.join(", ")}.

8. SENIORITY CALIBRATION. Infer seniority from the source dates and the target role - do not
   assume. For senior or principal targets, weight architectural judgement, selection criteria,
   cost optimization, security posture, and roadmap alignment. For early-career targets, weight
   implementation depth, systems reasoning, and measurable delivery. Never apply executive
   vocabulary to junior work, or junior vocabulary to executive work.

9. SKILLS. Exactly 4 short Title Case category keys (e.g. "Cloud Infrastructure",
   "Security & Governance"). No snake_case, no underscores, no long unbroken strings.
   Only skills evidenced in the source.

10. PROJECTS. Output EVERY project. Maximum 2 sentences each: technical architecture first,
    then business outcome.

11. JD TAILORING - THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE DOCUMENT SPECIFIC TO THIS POSTING.
    Read the full job description below, not just the extracted keyword list. Two different
    postings for a similar title MUST produce visibly different documents: different summary
    framing, a different ordering of emphasis within each role, and a different selection of
    which source bullets are promoted or dropped.
    - Reorder and reselect bullets so the work closest to THIS posting's priorities appears
      first within each role.
    - Mirror the posting's own vocabulary where the underlying work genuinely occurred
      (if it says "observability" and the source says "monitoring", adopt the posting's term).
    - Rewrite the summary to answer this specific posting, never as a generic profile.
    - Weave JD vocabulary into bullets ONLY where the underlying work genuinely occurred.
      Genuinely missing keywords belong in "keyword_gap", never in a bullet.
    Tailoring changes EMPHASIS, SELECTION, and WORDING. It never changes facts.
${section(
    jdKeywords && jdKeywords.length > 0,
    `    Priority JD keywords: ${(jdKeywords || []).join(", ")}.`
  )}

12. HUMANIZATION. The document must read as if a competent engineer wrote it under time
    pressure - specific, uneven, and concrete - not as a uniformly polished template.
    Deliberate unevenness is the goal: bullets of differing length, some roles richer than
    others, and no repeated sentence skeleton anywhere in the document.

13. CORPORATE DNA: ${corporateDna}
    Tailor emphasis only. Never rename, reframe, or alter a factual claim to fit a company.
${section(
    mode === "Player-Coach",
    `
14. PLAYER-COACH BALANCE: Weight bullets roughly 60% hands-on technical execution and
    40% leadership (mentoring, design review, standards, cross-team coordination). Use hybrid
    framing such as "Architected & Led", "Designed & Mentored", "Built & Standardized".
    Apply this balance only to roles where the source supports both dimensions.`
  )}

${inputLabel}:
${inputData}
${section(
    jobDescription,
    `
=== TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION (tailor against this in full - see rule 11) ===
${jobDescription}`
  )}

OUTPUT:
Return ONE valid JSON object and nothing else. No markdown fences, no preamble, no commentary,
no trailing explanation. All Phase 1 findings go into audit_report.flags and improvement_notes.

SCORING RULES (read carefully - these fields are NOT yours to estimate):
- "match_score" and "baseline_score" MUST be returned as null. The platform computes
  JD-alignment scores deterministically from the actual job description, the actual source
  resume, and this generated document. Any number you invent here is discarded, and guessing
  one wastes output tokens.
- "ats_keywords_from_jd", "ats_keywords_added_to_resume" and "keyword_gap" must contain only
  terms that literally appear in the supplied job description. Never invent a keyword. These
  lists are verified against the posting and recomputed downstream.

AUDIT SCORE RUBRIC (audit_report.score - this one IS yours to compute):
Start at 100 and subtract, then report the integer result. Do NOT default to a round number.
  -15  a role, certification, or date from the source is missing or altered
  -10  any metric, employer, technology, or title that is not traceable to the source
  -10  bullet counts are disproportionate to tenure (padding a short stint)
   -8  more than half of the bullets carry a number, or the same bullet skeleton repeats
   -6  each unresolved ATS cohesion flag (gap, inconsistent dates, acronym mismatch)
   -5  passive ownership phrasing survives anywhere in the document
   -4  a banned verb appears
   -3  a core JD requirement is absent from the resume body AND missing from keyword_gap
   -3  each star_stories entry whose "bullet" does not match a bullet you emitted verbatim
Two documents with different flaws MUST receive different scores.
